# Feature_Selection
Implementation of Python code to select feature for Intrusion Detection System using Optimization Algorithm.
The full code is in Python.
Here, I used kdd_Dataset.
As Optimization Algorithm I used here Particle Swarmp Optimization(PSO).
For classification, I used Support Vector Machine(SVM) as machine learning algorithm.
Accuracy is very high: 95% +
Codding implementation is very easy.
